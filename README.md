# About me
👋 Hi, I’m Anthony Igiligi

👀 I became interesed in **data analytics** and **machine learning** about 2 years ago through my interest in solving **statistical challenges** that I encountered in my current professional role as a research staff at a renewable energy institute. Having worked with *Excel* - depolying *Macros* with *VBA* for automating all my repeatitive borring calculations, and having encountered a complex evaluation during my **masters thesis project**, I discided to learn how to use data analytics tools and processes to solve these challenges.

> Currently, I have a **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** through the Google data analysis programme that taught me how to provide businessess with answeres through the data analysis process: *ask*, *prepare*, *process*, *analyze*, *share*, and *act*.

> I can confidently use: Spreadsheet tools (**Excel**, **Google Sheets**), **SQL**, **Python**, **R**, and **Tableau**

🌱 I’m currently learning **deep neural networks** because of **my current projects** in Conservation Voltage Reduction technology that can help us reduce our annual energy use at home. I am specifically working on how to optimize my models' performance and accuracy. I am also working on **data analytics projects** through competitions, and assisting businesses in understanding their **product's performance** and learning **trends** that can help them to improve.

💞️ I’m looking for an junior position in an analytics team of your business so that I can contribute my professional skills to help drive innovation.
