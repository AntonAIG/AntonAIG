# About me
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Anthony Igiligi

üëÄ I became interesed in **data analytics** and **machine learning** about 2 years ago through my interest in solving **statistical challenges** that I encountered in my past professional roles as a research staff at a renewable energy institute. Having worked with *Excel* - depolying *Macros* with *VBA* for automating all my repeatitive calculations, and having encountered a complex evaluation task during my **masters thesis project**, I discided to learn how to improve my data analysis skills and solve more challenges.

> Currently, I have a **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** through the Google data analysis programme that taught me how to provide businessess with answeres through the data analysis process: *ask*, *prepare*, *process*, *analyze*, *share*, and *act*.

> I have also completed machine learning courses: **Applied Machine Learning with Python** - University of Michigan, **Data Science and Machine Learning Web Application with Streamlit**, and some challenging projects.

> I can confidently use: Spreadsheet tools (**Excel**, **Google Sheets**), **SQL**, **Python**, **R**, and **Tableau** to solve business challenges in data analysis, making new discoveries as I move along the analysis process.

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning **regression and classification** methods within the general scope of **supervised machine learning** because of **my current projects** in Conservation Voltage Reduction technology that can help us reduce our annual energy use at home. I am specifically working on how to optimize my models' performance, introduce new features, and improve accuracy. I am also working on **data analytics projects** through competitions, and assisting businesses in understanding their **product's performance** and learning **trends** that can help them to improve.

üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for a junior/entry level position in the analytics team of your business so that I can contribute my professional skills to help drive innovation.

üì´ I can be reached on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-igiligi/)

I regularly upload my works here and I welcome your criticism and sugestions for improvement. We learn everyday.

# **Project Portfolio**
Here is a portfolio of my past projects in data analytics and data science.

## 1. [Google Data Analytics Capstone Project](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/reports/bellabeat_report.md)
#### Business task
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The marketing analytics team whould like to understand the performance of their product and customer response to product changes and improvement efforts.
* How can a wellness technology company play it smart?

The data contains daily, hourly, and munite-level output of: Activity, Calories, heartrate, Intensities, METs, Sleep, Steps, and weigth log info.
The dataset was futher processed in RStudio. Further summary statistics was carried out here to understand the relationships in the features of our dataset.

![figure1](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/reports/totalsteps_calories.png)

It is very benefitial to understand trends in every business by collecting unbiased data about the particular products that needs improvement, and customer responses to individual products and features. In addition, we need to also understand how our products affects their daily life and showcase how our device can improve certain aspects of their life. In the case of Bellabeat, our observation shows that:
* If users want to lose weight, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to control daily calorie consumption. Bellabeat can suggest some ideas for low-calorie lunch and dinner.
* Most activity happens between 5 pm and 7 pm - I suppose, that people go to a gym or for a walk after finishing work. Bellabeat can use this time to remind and motivate users to go for a run or walk.
* If users want to improve their sleep, Bellabeat should consider using app notifications to go to bed.

## 2. [Conservation Voltage Reduction Estimation and LSTM Modeling](https://github.com/AntonAIG/cvr_data_analytics/blob/main/README.md)
This is a repository of my Master's Thesis project in Renewable Energy Systems at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt.

CVR is a technique (such as VVO) that involves using a reduced voltage setpoint to reduce load demand from residential and industrial con-sumers in a distribution grid. It determines the load demand reduction during peak, and total energy savings achieved for a specific duration. By carrying out this operation regularly or based on a scheme, the utility can channel the excess power towards critical demand areas or new expansion. A CVR factor is the ratio between a percentage change in power or energy corresponding to a percentage change in voltage. A transformer equipped with a load tap changer can regulate voltage by a switching mechanism that alters voltage levels step-by-step. It is called a voltage regulated distribution transformer (VRDT).

The repository is divided into three parts:
* CVR factor evaluation for peak power demand reduction
* Estimation and visualization of CVR factors for energy savings
* LSTM Load Demand Forecasting

Each part deals with the various stages of data analytics and datascience.

The objective of the research was to show that:
1. Voltage reduction (CVR) can produce substantial savings in power and energy.
2. CVR benefits are affected by annual and daily seasonality.
3. Accuracy of power estimation can be improved by using bi-directional recurrent neural networks.

## 3. [Photovoltaic Systems Analysis](https://github.com/AntonAIG/photovoltaic_analytics)

The US National Renewable Energy laboratory (NREL), in colaboration with the Department of Energy's Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI) carried out an investigation of solar systems in the US.

The objective was to perform analysis for evaluating the performance of the solar systems on key metrices such as annual growth of system sizes and customer segmentation.

My role is to carryout this evaluation as outlined above and provide a summarized conclusion and recommendation for further actions. This is provided at the summary and recommendation section of this notebook.

## 4. [ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor](https://github.com/AntonAIG/energy_efficient_buildings/blob/main/ASHRAE_energy_eff/ashrae_building_eff.ipynb)

Residential and commercial buildings can be retrofited by insulation, use of energy saving load types, etc. The new energy consumption can be compared to the energy consumption profile assuming there was no retrofit. This can be presented as the benefit of implementing building retrofits, and thus customers can be billed adequately. Also, this can help draw financial support for developers planning to invest in building upgrades.

In this case study, 1000 retrofited buildings have chilled water, electricity, hot water, and steam meters that take measurement of real energy consumption for a 3-year period. Using this data, an estimate of energy consumption can be established for the purpose of billing. However, there is a small problem.

Accurate estimates of energy has been difficult to establish and scale such that various meters, and building types can use the same estimation model to evaluate the benefits of their retrofit. The investors want to know whether their improvements efforts are actually working. They want estimates of energy consumption without retrofits (assuming that the same uses of energy remain the same) using environmental factors that influence consumption such as ambient temperature, pressure, etc.

## 5. [eCommerce Events History in Cosmetics Shop](https://github.com/AntonAIG/e_commerce_analytics/blob/main/cosmetics_shop/cosmetics_shop_analysis.ipynb)

[REES46](https://rees46.com/) for eCommerce wants to analyze consumer behaviour through the use of datasets obtained for a three-month period, October - December 2019. They provide analytics services to online shops and websites that who want to track customer interaction, events and engagement. One of their USPs is to provide a dynamic dashboard that can record and present key metrics to their customers. These metrics will help them to understand customer interaction and engagement.

REES46 wants to know the best perfroming cosmetic product during the Christmas shoping season of 2019. They want to know what mad e it to be very successfull, and how to drive sales for other products.

The retailers can then use this information to improve the way the product is marketed.

## 6. [Hourly Power Consumption Profile of PJM](https://github.com/AntonAIG/gridwide_analytics/blob/main/PJME_load_profile.ipynb)

The JPM Interconnection LLC (JPM) is a TSO based in USA, and operating as part of the Eastern Interconnection grid. Their network coverage includes Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The data that was provided were historical data of power consumption for the Eastern Region herein refered to as JPME, from 2002 to 2018. The JPME dataset provides the means of evaluating the consumption partterns and seasonality trends in this region.

We want to:

Find trends in energy consumption around hours of the day, holidays, or long term trends.

Understand how daily trends change depending of the time of year. Summer trends are very different than winter trends.

## 7. [Load Archetypes for Customers Segmentation](https://github.com/AntonAIG/applied_ml_learning/blob/main/clustering/ashrae_load_archetypes.ipynb)

This project is based on the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III project available in Kaggle. Using the AMI measurements of just electricity, we can begin to perform a series of analysis to determine the consumer behavior and unique parterns.

A utility company that collects measurement data from its customers would like to know specific consumption behaviors and parterns that characterise all the customers. Some customers might have double peaks, some might have single peaks, while others have steadily rising profiles from morning till midnight. This knowledge can be used to further plan and recommend energy savings measures, peak reduction or cost reduction incentives.
