# About me
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Anthony Igiligi

üëÄ I became interesed in **data analytics** and **machine learning** about 2 years ago through my interest in solving **statistical challenges** that I encountered in my current professional role as a research staff at a renewable energy institute. Having worked with *Excel* - depolying *Macros* with *VBA* for automating all my repeatitive borring calculations, and having encountered a complex evaluation during my **masters thesis project**, I discided to learn how to use data analytics tools and processes to solve these challenges.

> Currently, I have a **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** through the Google data analysis programme that taught me how to provide businessess with answeres through the data analysis process: *ask*, *prepare*, *process*, *analyze*, *share*, and *act*.

> I can confidently use: Spreadsheet tools (**Excel**, **Google Sheets**), **SQL**, **Python**, **R**, and **Tableau**

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning **deep neural networks** because of **my current projects** in Conservation Voltage Reduction technology that can help us reduce our annual energy use at home. I am specifically working on how to optimize my models' performance and accuracy. I am also working on **data analytics projects** through competitions, and assisting businesses in understanding their **product's performance** and learning **trends** that can help them to improve.

üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for an junior position in an analytics team of your business so that I can contribute my professional skills to help drive innovation.

üì´ I can be reached on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-igiligi/)

I regularly upload my works here and I welcome your criticism and sugestions for improvement. We learn everyday.

# Project Portfolio
Here is a portfolio of my past projects in data analytics and data science.

## 1. [Google Data Analytics Capstone Project](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/reports/bellabeat_report.md)
#### Business task
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The marketing analytics team whould like to understand the performance of their product and customer response to product changes and improvement efforts.
* How can a wellness technology company play it smart?

The data contains daily, hourly, and munite-level output of: Activity, Calories, heartrate, Intensities, METs, Sleep, Steps, and weigth log info.
The dataset was futher processed in RStudio. Further summary statistics was carried out here to understand the relationships in the features of our dataset.

It is very benefitial to understand trends in every business by collecting unbiased data about the particular products that needs improvement, and customer responses to individual products and features. In addition, we need to also understand how our products affects their daily life and showcase how our device can improve certain aspects of their life. In the case of Bellabeat, our observation shows that:
* If users want to lose weight, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to control daily calorie consumption. Bellabeat can suggest some ideas for low-calorie lunch and dinner.
* Most activity happens between 5 pm and 7 pm - I suppose, that people go to a gym or for a walk after finishing work. Bellabeat can use this time to remind and motivate users to go for a run or walk.
* If users want to improve their sleep, Bellabeat should consider using app notifications to go to bed.
