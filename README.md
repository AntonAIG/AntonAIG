# About me
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Anthony Igiligi

üëÄ I became interesed in **data analytics** and **machine learning** about 2 years ago through my interest in solving **statistical challenges** that I encountered in my current professional role as a research staff at a renewable energy institute. Having worked with *Excel* - depolying *Macros* with *VBA* for automating all my repeatitive borring calculations, and having encountered a complex evaluation during my **masters thesis project**, I discided to learn how to use data analytics tools and processes to solve these challenges.

> Currently, I have a **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** through the Google data analysis programme that taught me how to provide businessess with answeres through the data analysis process: *ask*, *prepare*, *process*, *analyze*, *share*, and *act*.

> I can confidently use: Spreadsheet tools (**Excel**, **Google Sheets**), **SQL**, **Python**, **R**, and **Tableau**

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning **deep neural networks** because of **my current projects** in Conservation Voltage Reduction technology that can help us reduce our annual energy use at home. I am specifically working on how to optimize my models' performance and accuracy. I am also working on **data analytics projects** through competitions, and assisting businesses in understanding their **product's performance** and learning **trends** that can help them to improve.

üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for an junior position in an analytics team of your business so that I can contribute my professional skills to help drive innovation.

üì´ I can be reached on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-igiligi/)

I regularly upload my works here and I welcome your criticism and sugestions for improvement. We learn everyday.

# Project Portfolio
Here is a portfolio of my past projects in data analytics and data science.

## 1. [Google Data Analytics Capstone Project](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/reports/bellabeat_report.md)
#### Business task
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The marketing analytics team whould like to understand the performance of their product and customer response to product changes and improvement efforts.
* How can a wellness technology company play it smart?

The data contains daily, hourly, and munite-level output of: Activity, Calories, heartrate, Intensities, METs, Sleep, Steps, and weigth log info.
The dataset was futher processed in RStudio. Further summary statistics was carried out here to understand the relationships in the features of our dataset.

It is very benefitial to understand trends in every business by collecting unbiased data about the particular products that needs improvement, and customer responses to individual products and features. In addition, we need to also understand how our products affects their daily life and showcase how our device can improve certain aspects of their life. In the case of Bellabeat, our observation shows that:
* If users want to lose weight, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to control daily calorie consumption. Bellabeat can suggest some ideas for low-calorie lunch and dinner.
* Most activity happens between 5 pm and 7 pm - I suppose, that people go to a gym or for a walk after finishing work. Bellabeat can use this time to remind and motivate users to go for a run or walk.
* If users want to improve their sleep, Bellabeat should consider using app notifications to go to bed.

## 2. [Conservation Voltage Reduction Estimation and LSTM Modeling](https://github.com/AntonAIG/cvr_data_analytics/blob/main/README.md)
This is a repository of my Master's Thesis project in Renewable Energy Systems at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt.

CVR is a technique (such as VVO) that involves using a reduced voltage setpoint to reduce load demand from residential and industrial con-sumers in a distribution grid. It determines the load demand reduction during peak, and total energy savings achieved for a specific duration. By carrying out this operation regularly or based on a scheme, the utility can channel the excess power towards critical demand areas or new expansion. A CVR factor is the ratio between a percentage change in power or energy corresponding to a percentage change in voltage. A transformer equipped with a load tap changer can regulate voltage by a switching mechanism that alters voltage levels step-by-step. It is called a voltage regulated distribution transformer (VRDT).

The repository is divided into three parts:
* CVR factor evaluation for peak power demand reduction
* Estimation and visualization of CVR factors for energy savings
* LSTM Load Demand Forecasting

Each part deals with the various stages of data analytics and datascience.

The objective of the research was to show that:
1. Voltage reduction (CVR) can produce substantial savings in power and energy.
2. CVR benefits are affected by annual and daily seasonality.
3. Accuracy of power estimation can be improved by using bi-directional recurrent neural networks.

## 3. [Photovoltaic Systems Analysis](https://github.com/AntonAIG/photovoltaic_analytics)

The US National Renewable Energy laboratory (NREL), in colaboration with the Department of Energy's Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI) carried out an investigation of solar systems in the US.

The objective was to perform analysis for evaluating the performance of the solar systems on key metrices such as annual growth of system sizes and customer segmentation.

My role is to carryout this evaluation as outlined above and provide a summarized conclusion and recommendation for further actions. This is provided at the summary and recommendation section of this notebook.
